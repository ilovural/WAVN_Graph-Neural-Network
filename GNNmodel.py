'''
This file defines the GNN used to learn from the image-pair graphs
Notes: the class GNN is a simple 2-layer GCN that is followed by a global pooling & linear classification head
Global Pooling - technique that aggregates the features from all of the nodes in a graph into a single, fixed-size vector that represents the entire graph
Linear Classification Head - a simple, fully connected layer that takes the final learned node or graph representations and maps them to the desired output classes
